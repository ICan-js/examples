                I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should begin with
                definitions of the meaning of the terms "machine" and "think." The definitions might be
                framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is
                dangerous, If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by
                examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the
                meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a
                statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a
                definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is
                expressed in relatively unambiguous words.
            </par>

            <par>
                The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the
                'imitation game." It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an
                interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the
                other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other
                two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the
                end of the game he says either "X is A and Y is B" or "X is B and Y is A." The
                interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus: 

                <ul class="nes-list is-dist">
                    <li>C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?</li>
                </ul>

                Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the game to try and
    cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be:

                <ul class="nes-list is-dist">
                    <li>"My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long." </li>
                </ul>
            </par>

            <par>
                In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written,
                or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating
                between the two rooms. Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an
                intermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator.
                The best strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as
                "I am the woman, don't listen to him!" to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man
                can make similar remarks
            </par>
            
            <par>
                We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this
                game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as
                he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace
                our original, "Can machines think?"

        <h2 class="title">2. Critique of the New Problem</h2>
        
        <div align="justify">
            <par>
                As well as asking, "What is the answer to this new form of the question," one may ask,
                "Is this new question a worthy one to investigate?" This latter question we investigate
                without further ado, thereby cutting short an infinite regress. 
            </par>
            <par>
                The new problem has the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between the physical
                and the intellectual capacities of a man. No engineer or chemist claims to be able to
                produce a material which is indistinguishable from the human skin. It is possible that at
                some time this might be done, but even supposing this invention available we should feel
                there was little point in trying to make a "thinking machine" more human by dressing it
                up in such artificial flesh. The form in which we have set the problem reflects this fact in
                the condition which prevents the interrogator from seeing or touching the other
                competitors, or hearing -their voices. Some other advantages of the proposed criterion
                may be shown up by specimen questions and answers. Thus: 

                <ul class="nes-list is-dist">
                    <li>Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.</li>
                    <li>A : Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.</li>
                    <li>Q: Add 34957 to 70764.</li>
                    <li>A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621.</li>
                    <li>Q: Do you play chess?</li>
                    <li>A: Yes.</li>
                    <li>Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your
                    move. What do you play?</li>
                    <li>A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate.</li> 
                </ul>
            </par>
            <par>
                The question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing almost any one of
                the fields of human endeavour that we wish to include. We do not wish to penalise the
                machine for its inability to shine in beauty competitions, nor to penalise a man for losing
                in a race against an aeroplane. The conditions of our game make these disabilities
                irrelevant. The "witnesses" can brag, if they consider it advisable, as much as they please
                about their charms, strength or heroism, but the interrogator cannot demand practical
                demonstrations. 
            </par>
            <par>
                The game may perhaps be criticised on the ground that the odds are weighted too heavily
                against the machine. If the man were to try and pretend to be the machine he would
                clearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away at once by slowness and
                inaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out something which ought to be
                described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does? This objection is 
                a very strong one, but at least we can say that if, nevertheless, a machine can be
                constructed to play the imitation game satisfactorily, we need not be troubled by this
                objection.  
            </par>
            <par>
                It might be urged that when playing the "imitation game" the best strategy for the
                machine may possibly be something other than imitation of the behaviour of a man. This
                may be, but I think it is unlikely that there is any great effect of this kind. In any case
                there is no intention to investigate here the theory of the game, and it will be assumed that
                the best strategy is to try to provide answers that would naturally be given by a man.

        <h2 class="title">3. The Machines Concerned in the Game</h2>
        <div align="justify">
            
            <par>
                The question which we put in 1 will not be quite definite until we have specified what we
                mean by the word "machine." It is natural that we should wish to permit every kind of
                engineering technique to be used in our machines. We also wish to allow the possibility
                than an engineer or team of engineers may construct a machine which works, but whose
                manner of operation cannot be satisfactorily described by its constructors because they
                have applied a method which is largely experimental. Finally, we wish to exclude from
                the machines men born in the usual manner. It is difficult to frame the definitions so as to
                satisfy these three conditions. One might for instance insist that the team of engineers
                should be all of one sex, but this would not really be satisfactory, for it is probably
                possible to rear a complete individual from a single cell of the skin (say) of a man. To do
                so would be a feat of biological technique deserving of the very highest praise, but we
                would not be inclined to regard it as a case of "constructing a thinking machine." This
                prompts us to abandon the requirement that every kind of technique should be permitted.
                We are the more ready to do so in view of the fact that the present interest in "thinking
                machines" has been aroused by a particular kind of machine, usually called an "electronic
                computer" or "digital computer." Following this suggestion we only permit digital
                computers to take part in our game. 
            </par>
            <par>
                This restriction appears at first sight to be a very drastic one. I shall attempt to show that
                it is not so in reality. To do this necessitates a short account of the nature and properties
                of these computers. 
            </par>
            <par>
                It may also be said that this identification of machines with digital computers, like our
                criterion for "thinking," will only be unsatisfactory if (contrary to my belief), it turns out
                that digital computers are unable to give a good showing in the game. 
            </par>
            <par>
                There are already a number of digital computers in working order, and it may be asked,
                "Why not try the experiment straight away? It would be easy to satisfy the conditions of
                the game. A number of interrogators could be used, and statistics compiled to show how
                often the right identification was given." The short answer is that we are not asking
                whether all digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers at
                present available would do well, but whether there are imaginable computers which
                would do well. But this is only the short answer. We shall see this question in a different
                light later.
